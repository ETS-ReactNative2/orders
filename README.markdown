# The (New) Benchmark Ordering System #

At Benchmark, we use a paper system to file and retrive our orders. This system works... as long as everyone puts the orders back in the right spot, and they don't get lost, and... yeah. I went to look at making an online order tracking/entering system for us.

## History #

We make cemetery monuments, granite yard ornaments, pet memorials, bronze statuary bases, and many more things. Even our monuments get pretty complex; take these three: ![Kittterman](kitterman.jpg), ![garth](garth.jpg), and ![Bowlin](bowlin.jpg) for an example. 

Our ordfers get lost *mostly* through being moved around to be filed and/or processed.

## The Online Order Tracking System #

So. My vision for a computerized order tracking system.

### Version One (Initial) #
All this needs to do is allow the user to enter the existing fields in a computerized fashion. It should look as much like the current paper version *as possible*.

### Version One-Point-Five (Files) #
Same as 1.0, but also output a file containing the contents. Either XML or JSON. I'll come back to this...

### Version Two (Order Tracking) #
